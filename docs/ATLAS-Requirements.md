# ATLAS-Requirements

## 1. System Profile

- System Name: A.T.L.A.S.
- Expanded Name: Automated Timetabling and Locations Allocation System
- Description: A Web-Based Academic Scheduling Application
- Document Type: System Requirements Specification
- Version: 1.0.0
- Status: Draft for implementation alignment

## 2. Purpose and Objectives

A.T.L.A.S. must produce school-year scoped teacher schedules and room allocations that are policy-aware, conflict-free, and operationally practical for registrar and academic coordinators.

Primary objectives:

1. Generate valid timetables with minimal manual correction.
2. Enforce teaching-load semantics aligned with DepEd-oriented policy interpretation.
3. Allocate rooms/locations with capacity and resource constraints.
4. Keep EnrollPro as source of truth for teacher identity and designation metadata.

## 3. Scope

In scope:

- Faculty load computation and warnings.
- Section-subject timetable generation.
- Room/location assignment.
- Conflict detection and resolution support.
- Schedule publishing, versioning, and export.

Out of scope:

- Payroll computation.
- Student billing or fees.
- Learning content delivery.

## 4. Users and Roles

- System Admin: configures policies, school-year windows, and generation settings.
- Registrar/Academic Coordinator: runs schedule generation, reviews warnings, publishes schedules.
- Teacher: views assigned timetable and load summary.
- Read-only stakeholders: view published schedules and reports.

## 6. Data and Validation Requirements

1. Current EnrollPro model must keep one active designation snapshot per teacher and schoolYearId (preventing overlap by design in the present schema).
2. Designation numeric fields must be bounded and non-negative.
3. advisoryEquivalentHoursPerWeek defaults to 5 when isClassAdviser is true and no override is provided.
4. effectiveTo must not be earlier than effectiveFrom.
5. All designation changes must be auditable with updatedBy, updatedAt, and optional reason.
6. Section-subject demand totals must be validated before generation starts.

## 7. Integration and API Requirements

Minimum integration contract with EnrollPro:

1. Faculty sync endpoint includes schoolId and schoolYearId scope.
2. Payload includes teacher identity, active status, section count, designation metadata, and audit fields.
3. ATLAS must support pull-by-school-year and incremental refresh.
4. Integration failures must be retriable and logged with correlation IDs.

Recommended API surfaces:

- GET /teachers/atlas/faculty-sync?schoolYearId=
- POST /atlas/generation-runs
- GET /atlas/generation-runs/:id/report
- POST /atlas/schedules/:version/publish
- GET /atlas/exports?view=teacher|section|room

EnrollPro faculty sync payload contract (minimum required by ATLAS load engine):

- scope: schoolId, schoolYearId
- designation fields per faculty row:
- isClassAdviser
- advisoryEquivalentHoursPerWeek (default 5 when adviser if omitted during designation write)
- isTic
- isTIC (compatibility alias of isTic)
- isTeachingExempt
- customTargetTeachingHoursPerWeek
- designationNotes
- effectiveFrom
- effectiveTo

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

- Availability: 99.5% monthly for scheduling operations during peak windows.
- Performance: Medium-size school generation target under 3 minutes for baseline configuration.
- Scalability: Must support multi-school and multi-year datasets with tenant-safe separation.
- Reliability: Failed generation runs must not corrupt existing published versions.
- Observability: All generation runs must emit structured logs, run metrics, and diagnostic artifacts.

## 9. Security, Privacy, and Audit

1. Role-based access control must protect generation, override, and publish actions.
2. Read-only users must not mutate schedules.
3. Sensitive integration credentials must be stored in secure environment configuration.
4. Every mutation event must write an audit trail with actor, action, subject, and timestamp.

## 10. MVP Acceptance Criteria

A.T.L.A.S. MVP is acceptable when:

1. Scheduler can generate a full weekly timetable for at least one school year with no hard conflicts.
2. Teacher load computation reflects designation-aware semantics with warnings.
3. Room allocation respects capacity/type constraints.
4. Published schedules are versioned and exportable.
5. Faculty designation integration from EnrollPro is stable and auditable.
